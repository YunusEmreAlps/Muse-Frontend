## My Refine Journey ðŸš€

This is my journey with Refine. I will document my progress, challenges, and solutions as I explore the capabilities of Refine and build a project using the framework. I will share my insights, tips, and tricks to help others navigate the world of Refine and create amazing applications.

### First Problem: Customizing Login and Register Pages

When I designed Login and Register pages, I used Refine's hooks and components to simplify the development process and eliminate repetitive tasks. I was able to provide industry-standard solutions for crucial aspects of the project, including authentication, access control, routing, networking, state management, and i18n. But I can't modify the design of the pages as I want. I will try to learn more about Refine and see how I can customize the design to match my project's requirements. I solve the **Swizzle** to customize the design of the pages.
